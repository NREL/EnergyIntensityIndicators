Results
=======

The following EII decomposition results were calculated for each EIA sector 
(Transportation, Commercial, Residential, Industry, and the Electric Power Sector) using 1985 as a base year. All projections represented 
here use AEO 2020 Reference Scenario projection data. 

Formatted CSVs of LMDI results for each EIA sector (Transportation, Commercial, Residential, Industry, and the Electric Power Sector) 
can be found in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/NREL/EnergyIntensityIndicators/Results>`_. 

These results visualizations are not comprehensive; comprehensive results can be found `here <https://github.com/NREL/EnergyIntensityIndicators/Results>`_.
