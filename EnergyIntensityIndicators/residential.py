"""Overview and Assumptions:
A. Data on the number and average size of occupied housing units from the biennial American
Housing Survey were employed to generate many of the activity metrics for this sector.
B. Three types of residential housing units are distinguished: single-family, multi-family, and
manufactured homes.
C. Regional data from EIA’s State Energy Data System (SEDS) are employed to develop regional
intensity indicators.
D. Regression models at the regional level are used to adjust for year-to-year changes in weather.
E. Two separate data construction elements are required to generate the regional and national
estimates of energy intensity indicators for this sector.
    1. Regional time series of floor space for residential housing units in the U.S (census level).
    2. Weather adjustment for the four census regions.
